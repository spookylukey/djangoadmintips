djangoadmintips
===============

This is a repo of demo apps, accompanying the the twitter account
`@djangoadmintips <https://twitter.com/djangoadmintips>`_ and the blog posts at
http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/categories/django-admin/

Each folder is a self contained project. In each case:

* create a virtualenv (the code assumes Python 3, but Python 2 might work)
* install the dependencies in requirements.txt
* run the dev server using ``./manage.py runserver``
